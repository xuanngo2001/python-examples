The best way for me to master this is to write tutorials about this topic. If I\u0027m able to explain it, then it means that I understood the topic.\r\n\u003C!--more--\u003E\r\n\r\nIn the past, I always use [Drupal][drupal] as my content management system(CMS) but my current webserver can\u0027t handle another instance of [Drupal][drupal]. So, I decided to find something more lightweight and something that doesn\u0027t cost me much. I was looking at the famous [WordPress][wordPress] but it is still too heavy for what I want to do. My requirements are:\r\n\r\n- Write articles using Markdown syntax.\r\n- Able to add images.\r\n- Support syntax highlighting.\r\n- Support permanent link and redirect.\r\n- Link to other document.\r\n- People can comments.\r\n- Support Google Analytics and Ads.\r\n\r\n## Website\r\nAfter going through different CMS and Wiki engines, I stumbled on some static site generators such as [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Hugo][hugo]. The idea of creating a static website using these generators catches my attention. A static website is the simplest website that you can get. No need for database backend or PHP. The main disadvantage, of course, is that your website will lack dynamic features such as user comments or any fancy administration interface. I don\u0027t need those dynamic features except for user comments. This can be remedied by integrating Disqus service.\r\n\r\nStatic site generator is the perfect fit for me. It satisfies all my requirements. Now, I have to choose 1 of them. Even though [Jekyll][jekyll] is the most famous one, I chose to use [Hugo][hugo]. The reason is because to use it, you only need 1 binary file. You don\u0027t have to install anything. Simply use the binary file and you are good to go. Whereas for [Jekyll][jekyll], I have to install Ruby and other dependent packages too.\r\n\r\n## Hosting\r\nNow that I have chosen the framework for my website, I need to find a cheap webhosting provider. Nowadays, the cloud platform is a hot topic. I saw a lot of Youtube videos showing how to host [WordPress][wordPress] for free on Google Cloud Platform. So, I decided to investigate further in that direction. It turned out to be the perfect fit for my case. The free virtual machine option has a very limited resource, more specifically, it has 614MB of memory. It is more than enough to serve my static website. Some articles claim to be able to handle 100K hits per month with a [WordPress][wordPress] installation. Needless to say, I have chosen to go with the Google Cloud Platform. The step-by-step instructions are already available. What more could you ask for. Besides, it is a good opportunity for me to learn the Cloud platform.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nFor this website, I ended up buying my domain name from GoDaddy and hosting my Hugo website on Google Cloud virtual machine. For now, it has cost me a big total of 0.99$(for the domain name). It is now up and running with the vanilla installation of Hugo. The next step would be to customize the theme and crank out PowerShell tutorials.\r\n\r\n\r\n[jekyll]: https:\/\/jekyllrb.com\/\r\n[hugo]: https:\/\/gohugo.io\/\r\n[wordPress]: https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\r\n[drupal]: https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/","format":"markdown_geshi","processed":"\u003Cp\u003ERecently, I decided to learn PowerShell scripting language and I wanted to learn it well.
